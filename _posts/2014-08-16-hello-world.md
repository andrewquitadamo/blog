I'm a Ph.D student starting my second year at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte studying bioinformatics. I did my undergrad at the University of New Hampshire, where I majored in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology.  

While I may officially be a "biology person" I was programming way before that. I started dabbling in the eighth grade teaching myself Java by taking books out from the library. When I began thinking about the future, bioinformatics seemed like a perfect fit.

Now, I've decided to join the ranks of bioinformatics bloggers. I believe practicing writing is the key to becoming a good writer. I've also found that if I can clearly write about a subject, I thoroughly understand it.  This blog is a place for me to write about bioinformatics, programming, learning, teaching, open science, research and other related subjects that I'm interested in. I'm planning to update the blog at least once a month, but hopefully I'll be able to write more frequently than that.
