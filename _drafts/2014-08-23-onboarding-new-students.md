In our lab we have a slight problem. We keep getting new students. The student make up of the Bioinformatics department at UNCC might be a little different than departments at other schools. There are a few new PhD students each year, but most of the students are in the Masters program. Since I've joined the lab we have only had new master students join. This summer we had two join, and at the start of this semester two more. More students isn't in itself a problem, but how to get them up to speed is.  

Our lab is a purely computational lab, which means lots of coding and analysis. While most students are required to take the introductory programming course, the new students are in their first semester. Essentially they need to know how to program, but we can't wait a year for them to finish the intro class. Previously I've worked with the new lab members one-on-one or in small groups of two or three, but with so many new students and different schedules this method won't work any more. 

For a while I've been considering how to best teach the essential skills needed. When I asked this question over Twitter, several people suggested to send new lab memebers to a Software Carpentry bootcamp. We don't have the resources to send all the new students to a bootcamp, but the something along those lines is what we need. 

My wife is a High School English teacher, and this year she is experimenting with a flipped classroom. She is making lecture type videos that the students watch at home. I've taken the idea, and am hoping to use it to onboard the new students. Teaching the basics over and over again to each new student isn't a productive use of time, but making a few videos that cover the basics is. This way they can watch the videos on their own time, and I can help them with any questions. 

I'm starting with a video on command line basics, and one on Git and GitHub. I'm going to solicit feedback from the students as we go, and improve the process. I'm stepping into new territory for me, but I like trying new things. I'm not expecting a perfect method the first time, but rather slow continuous improvements.
