In our lab we have a slight problem. We keep getting new students. The student make up of the Bioinformatics department at UNCC might be a little different than departments at other schools. There are a few new PhD students each year, but most of the students are in the Masters program. Since I've joined the lab we have only had new master students join. This summer we had two join, and at the start of this semester two more. More students isn't in itself a problem, but how to get them up to speed is.  

Our lab is a purely computational lab, which means lots of coding and analysis. While most students are required to take the introductory programming course, the new students are in their first semester.
