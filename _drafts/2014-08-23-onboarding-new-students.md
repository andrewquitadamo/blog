In our lab we have a slight problem. We keep getting new students. The student make up of the Bioinformatics department at UNCC might be a little different than departments at other schools. There are a few new PhD students each year, but most of the students are in the Masters program. Since I've joined the lab we have only had new master students join. This summer we had two join, and at the start of this semester two more. More students isn't in itself a problem, but how to get them up to speed is.  

Our lab is a purely computational lab, which means lots of coding and analysis. While most students are required to take the introductory programming course, the new students are in their first semester. Essentially they need to know how to program, but we can't wait a year for them to finish the intro class. Previously I've worked with the new lab members one-on-one or in small groups of two or three, but with so many new students and different schedules this method won't work any more. 

For a while I've been considering how to best teach the essential skills needed. When I asked this question over Twitter, several people suggested to send new lab memebers to a Software Carpentry bootcamp. We don't have the resources to send all the new students to a bootcamp, but the concept is excellent.
